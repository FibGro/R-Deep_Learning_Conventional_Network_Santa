# Santa

In this study, we will implement a binary classification image dataset by using a deep learning model ("Convolutional Network") in R which can predict if an image is classified as "Santa Claus" or "Not Santa Clause". The process and workflow of this study follow code from [Adyatama](https://rpubs.com/Argaadya/image_conv).
